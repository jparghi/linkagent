**LinkAgent** is an **AI-powered connector framework** that lets users trigger service actions (e.g., creating Jira tickets, ServiceNow incidents) via **natural language**.

> Example: _"Hey LinkAgent, create a Jira ticket for the broken login form with high priority."_

### üöÄ Features
- Natural Language to Action (stubbed NLP -> JSON -> execute)
- Connector framework (mock Jira/ServiceNow) with clean SPI
- Idempotency handling (in-memory, public-safe)
- Observability via `/actuator/prometheus`
- One-click sanity (`make sanity`)
